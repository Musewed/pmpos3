# PM-POS 3.0

PM-POS is an experimental POS application that aims to solve operational problems on retail, restaurant or similar environments. I released this project to discuss how to use latest software tech for the benefit of SambaPOS community. Everything released under this project is PoC grade for now.

Note: _Unlike my previous PM-POS projects this project is a standalone POS application and will not need SambaPOS to operate._
